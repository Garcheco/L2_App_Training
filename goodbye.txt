Dear colleagues and friends,

I want to take a moment to say goodbye to all of you, as today will be my last day at NACC. After 2 years filled with learning and great moments, I now have a new opportunity ahead of me that brings important challenges.

I am truly grateful to everyone I had the pleasure of working with, sharing wonderful moments, and learning so much from during this time. And of course, I can't forget to mention the best team... my team: Nicolás Ramírez, Andrés Saunders, Vinoth Satia, Juan García, and Jonathan Pina. It has been an honor to walk this path with you all.

I wish you all the greatest success in what lies ahead, and of course, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. You not only have a good colleague, but also a friend.

Thank you for everything, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.

Best regards,
Sergio Contreras

Start of the speech:

"Hi [Manager's Name],

I wanted to talk to you personally to inform you that I’ve decided to leave the team. I've received a new opportunity with another company that presents new challenges I believe are important for my career growth.

I want to sincerely thank you for all the support you’ve given me over the past 2 years on the team. It’s been a period full of learning and great moments, and I’ve had the pleasure of working with an amazing group of people, both professionally and personally.

Of course, I can’t forget to mention how much I value the team. I’ve learned so much from everyone, and it’s been an honor to work side by side with people like Nicolás Ramírez, Andrés Saunders, Vinoth Satia, Juan García, and Jonathan Pina. I have no doubt they will all achieve great things, and I wish them the very best moving forward.

As for me, I want to make sure everyone knows that, although I’m leaving, they should feel free to reach out for anything. You don’t just have a colleague, you also have a friend. I’m very grateful for everything I’ve experienced here, and I hope our paths will cross again someday."

Closing the speech:

"Once again, thank you for your support during my time here. It’s been an invaluable experience, and I will always be grateful for everything I’ve learned under your leadership."

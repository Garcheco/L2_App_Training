SQL Interview questions-f

Q 1. Query is long running, what steps u will take?  
	1. Analyze the query
	2. Check indexes - for the appropriate index are in place for the tables being queried
	3. Check if we are using the right datatype in the columns being used
	— 4. In case this doesn’t work, asking for more resources to improve performance.


Q 2. What is a deadlock? How will you go about resolving deadlocks?
	it is when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release the data. This ones can occur when the transactions are trying to lock the same data in different order.

Q 3. What is Constraints and its types?
	SQL constraints used to specify rules for the data in a table, this ones are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table and we have 6 types of main constraints:
NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
UNIQUE
CHECK
DEFAULT
	And we could include also CREATE INDEX

Q 4. Different between Primary Key and Unique Key?
	The primary key is the main index of the table also the primacy cannot be NULL and each table can only had 1 Primary Key. Also the Primary Key have UNIQUE data.

Q 5. Difference between Delete, Truncate and Drop?
	DELETE: Will be remove only de data in the row/rows selected. 
	TRUNCATE: Will be Purge all the table and the table settings.
	DROP: Will be delete the table from the schema.

Q 6. Types of Statements in SQL?

	TCL - Transaction Control Language - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVE POINT
	DCL - Data Control Language - GRANT, REVOKE
	DML - Data Manipulation Language - INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
	DDL - Data Definition. Language - ALTER, CREATE, TRUNCATE, DROP
	DQL - Data Query Language: is used to fetch the data from the Database - SELECT
	

Q 7. What is TCL and DCL?	
	TCL - Transaction Control Language - these commands/statements are used to be committed in the database, and this commands can only use with DML commands like ex: COMMIT, ROLLBACK.

	DCL - Data Control Language - these commands are used to grant an take back authority from any database user. - GRANT, REVOKE.


Q 8. How many methods, we can use to insert the values in table?
	We can use 2 methods to insert values in a table. The first one specifying the column names and the value to be inserted:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, …)
VALUES (value1, value 2, value 3, …)

And the other option without specifying the column names, only inserting the values:

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value 2, value3, …)


Q 9. Query to insert the values is particular column?
	INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, …)
	VALUES (value1, value 2, value 3, …)

Q 10. Query to create new table from existing table?
CREATE TABLE new_table_name (
	column1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
    	column2 VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    	column3 DATE DEFAULT NULL
);

INSERT INTO new_table_name (column1, column2, column3)
SELECT old_table_column1, old_table_column1, old_table_column1
FROM old_table;

Q 11. Query to create new table from existing table without copying the data?

CREATE TABLE new_table_name 
SELECT *
FROM old_table_name
WHERE 1 = 0;


Q 12. Types of functions in SQL. (Particularly Single Row Function- Number, Character(substr & instr), Date Fun., Conversion Function, General Fun (NVL, NVL2))

AGGREGATE functions: SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT
STRING: CONCATE, SUBSTRING, LEN, CAST
DATE: YEAR, DAY, MONTH
NVL: IFNULL
NVL2: IS NOT NULL

Q 13.  Print the emp_name, Salary (with the commission) as Total_Income for all the employees. (If there is no commission only Salary Should print)

SELECT emp_name, CASE
WHEN commission >= 1 then salary + commission
ELSE salary
END AS Total_Income
FROM employees;
	

SELECT emp_name, CASE 
WHEN commission IS NOT NULL THEN salary + commission 
ELSE salary 
END AS Total_Income 
FROM employees;

Q 14. What is Group functions in SQL?
Also knowing like Aggregate functions, are used to perform operations on a set of values to return a single scalar value. Usually these functions are used with “GROUP BY” clause to group rows.

Q 15. Difference between ‘Where’ and ‘Having Clause’ (in which condition, we use having clause).
In SQL, both the WHERE and HAVING clauses are used to filter records. WHERE is used to filter record before any grouping are made. 
And HAVING is used to filter record after the ‘GROUP BY’ operation has been performed

Key Differences
Timing of Application:
WHERE filters rows before grouping.
HAVING filters groups after grouping.
Use of Aggregate Functions:
WHERE cannot use aggregate functions.
HAVING can use aggregate functions.
Scope:
WHERE is used to filter records in a SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statement before grouping.
HAVING is used to filter groups in a SELECT statement that involves GROUP BY.

Q 16. Query to fetch Ename, deptno, Max_Sal from each department from Employee table?

SELECT Ename, deptno, MAX(salary) as Max_sal
FROM employees
GROUP BY deptno, 

Q 17. Query to fetch the number of employees, hired every year. ( Columns- ename, hiredate’)

SELECT ename, YEAR(hiredate) AS year_hired, COUNT(*) as num_emp_hired
FROM employees
GROUP BY year_hired
ORDER BY year_hired DESC;

Q 18. Some scenario-based questions from Joins like below. (mainly Equi join & Inner join)


Q 19. From the Employee and Department table, write a query to fetch the departments where number of employees is greater than 8?
SELECT d.deptno, d.deptname, COUNT(e.empno) AS num_emp
FROM Department d 
JOIN Employee e 
ON d.deptno = e.deptno 
GROUP BY d.deptno, d.deptname 
HAVING num_emp > 8;

Q 20. Types of joines with explanation? 
INNER JOIN: selects records that have matching values in both tables being joined. It excludes rows that do not have matches in the other table.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: is the opposite of a LEFT JOIN. It includes all rows from the right table and only those from the left table that match the join condition. Non-matching rows from the left table result in NULLs in the result set.
FULL OUTER JOIN: combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. It returns rows that have matching values in both tables, plus rows from the left table with no match in the right table (resulting in NULLs), and rows from the right table with no match in the left table (resulting in NULLs).

Q 21. What is Index in SQL and types? (with SYNTAX)
It’s a way to improve your query perfomance creating an INDEX of a column. We have 3 types of INDEX:
	Primary Key index: 
	Unique Index: CREATE DISTINCT INDEX idx_index-name
			FROM table_name
	Non-Unique index

An INDEX is a object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage space and potential write performance overhead. INDEXes are created on columns that are frequently used in search, these ones works similarly to indexes in books, allowing the database to find data quickly without scanning the entire table.

Types of Indexes in SQL
Single-Column Index
	CREATE INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column_name);
Composite Index
	CREATE INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
Unique Index
	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column_name);
Full-Text Index
	CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column_name);
Clustered Index
	CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column_name);
Non-Clustered Index
	CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX index_name
	ON table_name (column_name);



Q 22. Difference between Index Scan and  Full table Scan in SQL?
you want to optimize your queries to leverage index scans whenever possible for improved performance. 


Q 23. What is view and its types?
A view acts like a virtual table. It doesn’t store data itself but provides a way to see data from one or more underlying tables. 

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an statement. A view contains rows and columns just like a real table. The fields are from one or more tables in the DB.

Types of view: there are two main types of views
Simple Views
		CREATE VIEW view_name AS
	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
Complex Views
	CREATE VIEW view_name AS 
	SELECT column1, column2, ... 
	FROM table1 
	JOIN table2 ON join_condition1 
	JOIN tableN ON join_conditionN 
	WHERE filter_condition 
	GROUP BY group_column1, group_column2, ... 
	HAVING aggregation_condition 
	ORDER BY order_column ASC|DESC;

Q 24. Query to find 7th highest salary?

SELECT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY scary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 6;

	FROM Employees 
	) ranked_salaries 
WHERE salary_rank = 7;

Q 25. Query to find duplicate rows in table?

	SELECT column1, COUNT(*) AS dup_rows
	FROM table_name
	GROUP BY column1	
	HAVING dup_rows > 1;

Q 26. Query to delete duplicate rows in table?

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY column_name
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);

Q 27. Query to fetch last record from the table?
	SELECT *
	FROM table_name
	WHERE Primary_Key = (SELECT MAX(Primary_Key) FROM table_name);

	SELECT *
	FROM table_name
	ORDER BY Primary Key DESC
	LIMIT 1;


Q 28. Query to fetch even/odd rows from the table?

	SELECT *
	FORM table_name

	SELECT *
	FORM table_name
	WHERE primary_key % 2 = 0;     es cuando es par

	
	SELECT CASE 
	WHEN user_id % 2 = 0 then 'The ROW is EVEN'
	WHEN user_id % 2 = 1 then 'The ROW is ODD'
	END AS Even_Or_Odd
	FROM users;



Q 29. Rank and Dense rank concepts?
	
	RANK() function is a window function that assigns a rank to each row in the partition of a result set. The same column values receive the same ranks. 
When multiple rows share the same rank, the rank of the next row is not consecutive. 
For example the first and the second row share the same rank because they have the same value. The third row gets the rank 3 because the RANK() function skips the ranks 2.

EX.1-10, 1-10, 3-9, 3-9, 3-9, 3-9, 7-8…….

	If we want to have consecutive ranks, we can use the DENSE RANK() function, also is a window function that assigns consecutive ranks to rows in an ordered partition.

EX 1-1-, 1-10, 2-9, 2-9, 2-9, 2-9, 3-8…….


Q 30. Special operators uses (%, _ with like)

‘%’ wildcard - matches zero or more characters,  
EX —> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE ‘abc%’; - finds any values that start with ‘abc’

‘_’ matches exactly ONLY one character.
EX —> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE ‘a_c’; - fins any values with ‘a’ as the first character, ‘c’ as the third character, and any SINGLE character in between.

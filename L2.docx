UNIX Interview questions-

Q 2. How to print the hidden files? 
Ls –a
To print or display hidden files in a Unix/Linux terminal, you can use the ls command with the -a option. Hidden files in Unix/Linux typically start with a dot (.), and the -a option allows ls to show all files, including those whose names begin with a dot.

Q 3. How to display the files in a directory, size less than 4 MB?
Find  -type f -size –4M
find /path/to/directory -type f -size -4M -a -not -name '.*'
Let's break down the options used in this command:
/path/to/directory: Replace this with the actual path to the directory you want to search.
-type f: This option specifies that you are looking for regular files (not directories or other types of files).
-size -4M: This option specifies the size criteria. In this case, it looks for files smaller than 4 megabytes. The - sign before 4M indicates "less than."
This command will display a list of files in the specified directory and its subdirectories that are smaller than 4 megabytes.
